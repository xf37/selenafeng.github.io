<h2 class="style1">About Me</h2>
<ul>

I am a Ph.D. in Geography (Spatial Data Science) from <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/"> the University of California - Santa Barbara </a> and plan to graduate in 2019 Fall. My research revolves spatial optimization and statistical modeling (including location & allocation models, routing optimization, regression models, and clustering), with applications to medical drone delivery, meetup location finding, and nighttime light coverage. I have deep expertise with analyzing both structured and unstructured large-scale geospatial data. I have published 10+ peer-reviewed papers with 150+ total citations. Outside academia, I worked as a Data Scientist Intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was recently a Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/"> Insight Data Science (Silicon Valley) </a>. Furthermore, I have extensive hands-on experience in machine learning and its applications, winning top 1% in two <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gisxfeng"> Kaggle competitions </a> collaboratively. I am fluent in Python, Matlab, Gurobi, R, and SQL. <p>
